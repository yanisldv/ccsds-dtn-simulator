    "Modern space missions rely on complex communication architectures that must operate reliably across vast distances, intermittent connectivity, and harsh physical environments. Traditional Internet protocols such as TCP/IP cannot support multi-minute delays, long disconnections, or high bit-error rates typically encountered in deep-space links. For these reasons, space agencies such as NASA and ESA rely on standardized communication layers defined by CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems), together with delay-tolerant networking (DTN) protocols used for interplanetary communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite decades of engineering focused on reliability, cybersecurity has become a major concern in space systems. Attacks such as jamming, replay, message tampering, node compromise, and supply-chain threats now represent realistic scenarios for both near-Earth satellites and future deep-space missions. As spacecraft become more autonomous and interconnected—extending from LEO platforms to lunar gateways and Mars exploration—protecting the integrity and authenticity of command, telemetry, and science data is increasingly critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a simulation framework of a representative space communication stack, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -CCSDS Space Packets (telecommand / telemetry)\n",
    "    -CCSDS error control (e.g., HMAC, sequence counters, Reed–Solomon)\n",
    "    -DTN Bundle Protocol (BPv7/BPv8) used for the Interplanetary Internet\n",
    "    -BPSEC security extensions (BIB integrity protection)\n",
    "    -Store-and-forward routing with contact windows\n",
    "    -Multi-hop relays (Rover → Orbiter → Relay → Earth)\n",
    "    -We also simulate several realistic cyber-attacks against these layers:\n",
    "    -Replay of CCSDS packets\n",
    "    -Bit-flip corruption and jamming at the physical layer\n",
    "    -MITM modification of DTN bundles in intermediate nodes\n",
    "    -Selective drop and delay attacks\n",
    "    -Injection of falsified telemetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Each attack is evaluated together with the defense mechanisms implemented at different layers of the space communication stack (HMAC, sliding-window anti-replay, BPSEC BIB, Reed–Solomon, store-and-forward, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this work is to provide a safe, portable, and reproducible environment that demonstrates how representative space protocols behave under realistic conditions, how different layers complement each other for defense-in-depth, and how vulnerabilities or misconfigurations can compromise mission safety. This environment can support cyber-security research, protocol auditing, and threat modelling for future space missions and the Solar System Internet."

    "Although this project demonstrates multiple cyber-physical attacks such as replay, bit-flip, jamming and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), it is important to highlight that their real-world probability differs significantly depending on the attack type and the adversary’s capabilities. Physical-layer attacks such as jamming and signal interference are by far the most realistic and historically observed threats, as they only require RF transmission power and antenna alignment. Such attacks have been repeatedly reported in real satellite operations and are even used in electronic warfare doctrine. Bit-flip errors due to radiation are not attacks but natural physical phenomena, and they occur continuously in space, which fully justifies the systematic use of FEC and CRC mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, true cryptographic MITM attacks at the DTN or CCSDS level are extremely unlikely in practice. Successfully performing such an attack would require physical access to a relay satellite, compromise of onboard firmware, or a large-scale supply chain intrusion — all of which are state-level operations with very high technical and political cost. Likewise, replay attacks at RF level are more realistic for low-cost adversaries but are effectively mitigated by modern CCSDS sliding windows and DTN bundle identification mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while this simulator intentionally models worst-case cyberattack scenarios to validate security mechanisms, it is essential to distinguish between high-probability operational threats (jamming, link disruption, radiation errors) and low-probability but high-impact strategic threats (MITM, supply-chain compromise, relay impersonation). This distinction reflects real space cybersecurity risk models used by space agencies and defense organizations."
