# 🛰 Secure Space Communications Simulator (CCSDS, DTN & BPSEC)

This project is simplified full-stack simulation of **secure space communications**, combining real-world space communication standards and cybersecurity mechanisms. It models how scientific data is securely transmitted from a planetary surface (Mars Rover) to Earth through a **multi-hop interplanetary network** under realistic physical constraints and cyberattacks.

The simulator integrates:
- **CCSDS Space Packet Protocol**
- **DTN (Bundle Protocol v7)**
- **BPSEC (BIB – Bundle Integrity Block)**
- **HMAC, Anti-Replay Sliding Windows**
- **Store-and-Forward Routing**
- **Jamming, Bit-Flip, Replay & MITM Attacks**

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Simulate **realistic interplanetary communications**
- Demonstrate **defense-in-depth security architecture**
- Analyze the impact of **cyber and physical-layer attacks**
- Model **DTN store-and-forward behavior**
- Evaluate **end-to-end integrity using BPSEC**
- Provide an educational **space cybersecurity testbed**
